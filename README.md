A React application using Redux Toolkit for state management, allowing users to dynamically manage a dashboard with multiple categories and widgets. Users can add, remove, and search widgets, with state persisted in localStorage.

2 Add Widgets
Users can add a widget to any category by specifying the widget name and widget text.
3 Remove Widgets
Each widget has a cross (X) button to remove it from its category.
4 Search Widgets
Users can search across all widgets using a search bar.
5 State Management & Persistence
All state is managed via Redux and persisted in localStorage to maintain data across page reloads.
